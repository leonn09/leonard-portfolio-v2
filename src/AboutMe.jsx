          I enjoy solving problems through code and turning ideas into functional, user-friendly web pages. Right now, I'm focused on strengthening my foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while building projects that reflect my growth as a developer. My goal is to keep improving every day, learn best practices, and eventually contribute to real-world projects that create value.
